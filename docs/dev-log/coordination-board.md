# Coordination Board

## Active Lane Split

- Julia lane: this repository, `HSquared.jl`.
- R lane: sibling repository, `hsquared`.
- Coordinator lane: shared issue ledger, public-claim wording, and
  cross-repo contract checks.

## Current Rule

This Julia thread edits only `HSquared.jl`. The R/coordinator twin edits
`hsquared`.

## Shared Contract

- `hsquared` is the R public identity.
- `HSquared.jl` is the Julia engine.
- Phase 0 is operating system plus honest scaffold only.
- Fitting is planned, not implemented.
- Public claims require code, tests, docs, validation rows, and Rose audit.

## Current State

- Phase 0 public scaffold: complete.
- Public repos: `itchyshin/hsquared` and `itchyshin/HSquared.jl`.
- Initial GitHub issue ledger: issues #1-#7 in both repos.
- Phase 1 Julia lane started: pedigree normalization and direct sparse `Ainv`
  utility implemented locally.
- Next Julia lane: fixed-effect and animal random-effect design handling.
- R/coordinator sync needed after this slice: R docs should say `Ainv`
  construction exists in the Julia engine, but fitting remains planned.

## Sister References

- `DRM.jl`: Julia twin discipline, DocumenterVitepress structure, bridge
  contract, quality gates, and GPL-to-MIT provenance guardrails.
- `GLLVM.jl`: Julia engine role discipline, Documenter status pages, speed-claim
  evidence rules, and cross-project scout cadence.
- `drmTMB` / `gllvmTMB`: R-side documentation/status discipline and public
  fitted/planned/missing separation.
