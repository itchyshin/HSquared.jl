# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Added pedigree normalization and sparse `Ainv` construction utilities.
- Added low-level animal-model specification validation.
- Added dense Gaussian ML/REML log-likelihood evaluation at supplied variance
  components.
- Added experimental dense variance-component optimization for validated
  low-level animal-model specs.
- Added experimental low-level variance-component, fixed-effect, EBV/BLUP,
  fitted-value, and heritability extractors for the dense spec path.
- Added experimental direct payload `fit_animal_model(y, X, Z, Ainv; ...)`
  target for bridge-shaped inputs.
- Added a Henderson mixed-model-equation validation fixture for the dense
  output path.
- Added `result_payload()` with field names aligned to the R `hsquared_fit`
  extractor contract.
- Added `HSData`, `HSDataIDMap`, and `id_map()` as an in-memory mirror of the R
  `hs_data()` input-container contract.
- Added DocumenterVitepress documentation scaffold.
- Added audience and comparator programme notes.
- Added genomics/QTL/eQTL/GLLVM/GPU/HPC strategic roadmap.
